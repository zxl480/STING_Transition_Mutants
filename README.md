"toppar": 
Contains force field parameter files for running the simulation.
The topology and parameters for GMP and AMP can be found in the toppar_all36_na_nad_ppi.str file. 

"STINGactive" and "STINGinactive": 
Includes the NAMD input files, as well as the starting and final structures of STING in the active and inactive states.

"STINGMutants": 
Provides the final confirmations of simulations for STING mutants.

"STING_Transition_Inactive_to_Active" and "STING_Transition_Active_to_Inactive":   
Contains a comprehensive list of input files required to run the simulations for the conformation transition of STING, either from the inactive to active state or vice versa.

"Evolution": 
Contains files related to the phylogenetic tree analysis of the STING connector region.
